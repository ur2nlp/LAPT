There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.

according to the custom of the priest's office, his lot was to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. bi biuhtja gudjinassaus hlauts imma urrann du saljan, atgaggands in alh fraujins,

Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. jah gadrobnoda Zakarias gasaihvands, jah agis disdraus ina.
For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and he will drink no wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb. wairþiþ auk mikils in andwairþja fraujins jah wein jah leiþu ni drigkid jah ahmins weihis gafulljada nauhþan in wambai aiþeins seinaizos,

The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marveled that he delayed in the temple. jah was managei beidandans Zakariins, jah sildaleikidedun hva latidedi ina in þizai alh.

But he said to them, "I must preach the good news of the Kingdom of God to the other cities also. For this reason I have been sent." þaruh is qaþ du im þatei jah þaim anþaraim baurgim wailamerjan ik skal bi þiudangardja gudis, unte duþe mik insandida.

jah andhafjands Seimon qaþ du imma: talzjand, alla naht þairharbaidjandans waiht ni nemum; iþ afar waurda þeinamma wairpam natja. Simon answered him, "Master, we worked all night, and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net."

But Simon Peter, when he saw it, fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord." gaumjands þan Seimon Paitrus draus du kniwam Iesuis qiþands: [bidja þuk] usgagg fairra mis, unte manna frawaurhts im, frauja.

He charged him to tell no one, "But go your way, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing according to what Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."
But the report concerning him spread much more, and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. usmernoda þan þata waurd mais bi ina, jah garunnun hiuhmans managai hausjon jah leikinon fram imma sauhte seinaizo.

But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered them, "Why are you reasoning so in your hearts? ufkunnands þan Iesus mitonins ize andhafjands qaþ du im: hva biþagkeiþ in hairtam izwaraim?
Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you;' or to say, 'Arise and walk?' hvaþar ist azetizo qiþan: afletanda þus frawaurhteis, þau qiþan: urreis jah gagg?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" (he said to the paralyzed man), "I tell you, arise, and take up your cot, and go to your house." aþþan ei witeid þatei waldufni habaid sa sunus mans ana airþai afletan frawaurhtins, qaþ du þamma usliþin: du þus qiþa, urreis jah ushafjands þata badi þeinata gagg in gard þeinana.

He said to them, "Can you make the friends of the bridegroom fast, while the bridegroom is with them? þaruh is qaþ du im: ni magud sununs bruþfadis, unte sa bruþfads miþ im ist, gataujan fastan.
But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast in those days." aþþan qimand dagos, jah þan afnimada af im sa bruþfads, jah þan fastand in jainaim dagam.
He also told a parable to them. "No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old garment, or else he will tear the new, and also the piece from the new will not match the old. qaþuh þan jah gajukon du im, þatei ainshun plat snagins niujis ni lagjid ana snagan fairnjana, aiþþau jah sa niuja aftaurnid, jah þamma fairnjin ni gatimid þata af þamma niujin.

But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved. ak wein juggata in balgins niujans giutand, jah bajoþs gafastanda.
No man having drunk old wine immediately desires new, for he says, 'The old is better.'" jah ainshun drigkandane fairni, ni suns wili jugg; qiþiþ auk: þata fairnjo batizo ist.
Now it happened on the second Sabbath after the first, that he was going through the grain fields. His disciples plucked the heads of grain, and ate, rubbing them in their hands. Jah warþ in sabbato anþaramma frumin gaggan imma þairh atisk, jah raupidedun ahsa siponjos is jah matidedun bnauandans handum.
But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do that which is not lawful to do on the Sabbath day?" iþ sumai Fareisaie qeþun du im: hva taujid þatei ni skuld ist taujan in sabbato dagam?
how he entered into the house of God, and took and ate the show bread, and gave also to those who were with him, which is not lawful to eat except for the priests alone?" hvaiwa inngalaiþ in gard gudis jah hlaibans faurlageinais usnam jah matida jah gaf þaim miþ sis wisandam, þanzei ni skuld ist matjan, nibai ainaim gudjam?

But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Rise up, and stand in the middle." He arose and stood. iþ is wissuh mitonins ize jah qaþ du þamma mann, þamma þaursja habandin handu: urreis jah stand in midjaim. þaruh is urreisands gastoþ.

"Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, will be given to you.{literally, into your bosom.} For with the same measure you measure it will be measured back to you."
Or how can you tell your brother, 'Brother, let me remove the speck of chaff that is in your eye,' when you yourself don't see the beam that is in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck of chaff that is in your brother's eye. aiþþau hvaiwa magt qiþan du broþr þeinamma: broþar let, ik uswairpa gramsta þamma in augin þeinamma, silba in augin þeinamma anza ni gaumjands? liuta, uswairp faurþis þamma anza us augin þeinamma, jah þan gaumjais uswairpan gramsta þamma in augin broþrs þeinis.
The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings out that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings out that which is evil, for out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks. þiuþeigs manna us þiuþeigamma huzda hairtins seinis usbairid þiuþ, jah ubils manna us ubilamma hairtins seinis usbairid ubil: uzuh allis ufarfullein hairtins rodeid munþs is.

Those who were sent, returning to the house, found that the servant who had been sick was well. jah gawandjandans sik þai insandidans du garda bigetun þana siukan skalk hailana.

Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John the things which you have seen and heard: that the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. jah andhafjands Iesus qaþ du im: gaggandans gateihats Iohannen þatei gasehvuts jah gahausideduts, þatei blindai ussaihvand, haltai gaggand, þrutsfillai gahrainjanda, baudai gahausjand, naweis urreisand, unledai wailamerjanda;

"For I tell you, among those who are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptizer, yet he who is least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he."
But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God, not being baptized by him themselves. iþ Fareisaieis jah witodafastjos runa gudis fraqeþun ana sik, ni daupidai fram imma.

Those on the rock are they who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; but these have no root, who believe for a while, then fall away in time of temptation. iþ þai ana þamma staina, ize þan hausjand, miþ faheidai andnimand þata waurd, jah þai waurtins ni haband, þaiei du mela galaubjand jah in mela fraistubnjos afstandand.

When Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man out of the city who had demons for a long time met him. He wore no clothes, and didn't live in a house, but in the tombs.
For Jesus was commanding the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For the unclean spirit had often seized the man. He was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the desert. unte anabaud ahmin þamma unhrainjin usgaggan af þamma mann; manag auk mel frawalw ina, jah bundans was eisarnabandjom jah fotubandjom fastaiþs was, jah dishniupands þos bandjos draibiþs was fram þamma unhulþin ana auþidos.

All the people of the surrounding country of the Gadarenes asked him to depart from them, for they were very much afraid.

When the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared to him in the presence of all the people the reason why she had touched him, and how she was healed immediately. gasaihvandei þan so qino þatei ni galaugnida, reirandei <qam> jah atdriusandei du imma, in þizei attaitok imma, gataih imma in andwairþja allaizos manageins jah hvaiwa gahailnoda suns.

It happened, as they were parting from him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good for us to be here.

While he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed him violently. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. þaruh nauhþan duatgaggandin imma, gabrak ina sa unhulþa jah tahida. gahvotida þan Iesus ahmin þamma unhrainjin jah gahailida þana magu jah atgaf ina attin is.
They were all astonished at the majesty of God.

Now after these things, the Lord also appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two ahead of him{literally, "before his face"} into every city and place, where he was about to come.

jah warþ in jainaim dagam, qam Iesus fram Nazaraiþ Galeilaias jah daupiþs was fram Iohanne in Iaurdane. It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
jah suns usgaggands us þamma watin gasahv usluknans himinans jah ahman swe ahak atgaggandan ana ina. Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness. jah suns sai, ahma ina ustauh in auþida.
He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals; and the angels were serving him. jah was in þizai auþidai dage fidwor tiguns fraisans fram Satanin, jah was miþ diuzam, jah aggileis andbahtidedun imma.
Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Good News of the Kingdom of God, iþ afar þatei atgibans warþ Iohannes, qam Iesus in Galeilaia merjands aiwaggeljon þiudangardjos gudis,

jah hvarbonds faur marein Galeilaias gasahv Seimonu jah Andraian broþar is, þis Seimonis, wairpandans nati in marein; wesun auk fiskjans. Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
jah qaþ im Iesus: hirjats afar mis, jah gatauja igqis wairþan nutans manne. Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men."
jah jainþro inngaggands framis leit<ilat>a gasahv Iakobu þana Zaibaidaiaus jah Iohanne broþar is, jah þans in skipa manwjandans natja. Going on a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who were also in the boat mending the nets.
jah galiþun in Kafarnaum, jah suns sabbato daga galeiþands in swnagogen laisida ins. They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
jah usfilmans waurþun ana þizai laiseinai is; unte was laisjands ins swe waldufni habands jah ni swaswe þai bokarjos. They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
jah was in þizai swnagogen ize manna in unhrainjamma ahmin jah ufhropida Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
qiþands: fralet, hva uns jah þus, Iesu Nazorenai, qamt fraqistjan uns? kann þuk, hvas þu is, sa weiha gudis. saying, "Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God!"
Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!" jah andbait ina Iesus qiþands: þahai jah usgagg ut us þamma, ahma unhrainja.
The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him. jah tahida ina ahma sa unhrainja jah hropjands stibnai mikilai usiddja us imma.
They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him!" jah afslauþnodedun allai sildaleikjandans, swaei sokidedun miþ sis misso qiþandans: hva sijai þata? hvo so laiseino so niujo, ei miþ waldufnja jah ahmam þaim unhrainjam anabiudiþ jah ufhausjand imma?

He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them. jah duatgaggands urraisida þo undgreipands handu izos, jah aflailot þo so brinno suns, jah andbahtida im.

jah so baurgs alla garunnana was at daura. All the city was gathered together at the door.
jah qaþ du im: gaggam du þaim bisunjane haimom jah baurgim, ei jah jainar merjau, unte duþe qam. He said to them, "Let's go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, because I came out for this reason."
A leper came to him, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean." jah qam at imma þrutsfill habands, bidjands ina jah kniwam knussjands jah qiþands du imma þatei jabai wileis, magt mik gahrainjan.
Being moved with compassion, he stretched out his hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made clean." iþ Iesus infeinands, ufrakjands handu seina attaitok imma jah qaþ imma: wiljau, wairþ hrains.
He strictly warned him, and immediately sent him out, jah gahvotjands imma suns ussandida ina
and said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them." jah qaþ du imma: saihv ei mannhun ni qiþais waiht; ak gagg þuk silban ataugjan gudjin jah atbair fram gahraineinai þeinai þatei anabauþ Moses du weitwodiþai im.
But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere. iþ is usgaggands dugann merjan filu jah usqiþan þata waurd, swaswe is juþan ni mahta andaugjo in baurg galeiþan, ak uta ana auþjaim stadim was; jah iddjedun du imma allaþro.
When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house. Jah galaiþ aftra in Kafarnaum afar dagans, jah gafrehun þatei in garda ist.
jah suns gaqemun managai, swaswe juþan ni gamostedun nih at daura, jah rodida im waurd. Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them.
Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him. jah qemun at imma usliþan bairandans, hafanana fram fidworim.
But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts, wesunuh þan sumai þize bokarje jainar sitandans jah þagkjandans sis in hairtam seinaim:

jah suns ufkunnands Iesus ahmin seinamma þatei swa þai mitodedun sis, qaþ du im: duhve mitoþ þata in hairtam izwaraim? Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason these things in your hearts?
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the paralytic-- aþþan ei witeiþ þatei waldufni habaiþ sunus mans ana airþai afletan frawaurhtins, qaþ du þamma usliþin:
He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!" jah urrais suns jah ushafjands badi usiddja faura andwairþja allaize, swaswe usgeisnodedun allai jah hauhidedun mikiljandans guþ, qiþandans þatei aiw swa ni gasehvun.
It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him. jah warþ, biþe is anakumbida in garda is, jah managai motarjos jah frawaurhtai miþanakumbidedun Iesua jah siponjam is; wesun auk managai jah iddjedun afar imma.

The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"
jah wesun siponjos Iohannis jah Fareisaieis fastandans; jah atiddjedun jah qeþun du imma: duhve siponjos Iohannes jah Fareisaieis fastand, iþ þai þeinai siponjos ni fastand? John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't fast?"
Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can't fast. jah qaþ im Iesus: ibai magun sunjus bruþfadis, und þatei miþ im ist bruþfaþs, fastan? swa lagga hveila swe miþ sis haband bruþfad, ni magun fastan.
jah warþ þairhgaggan imma sabbato daga þairh atisk, jah dugunnun siponjos is skewjandans raupjan ahsa. It happened that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.
jah Fareisaieis qeþun du imma: sai, hva taujand siponjos þeinai sabbatim þatei ni skuld ist? The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"
jah is qaþ du im: niu ussuggwuþ aiw hva gatawida Daweid, þan þaurfta jah gredags was, is jah þai miþ imma? He said to them, "Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry--he, and those who were with him?
Jah galaiþ aftra in swnagogen, jah was jainar manna gaþaursana habands handu. He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
jah witaidedun imma hailidediu sabbato daga, ei wrohidedeina ina. They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.
He said to the man who had his hand withered, "Stand up." jah qaþ du þamma mann þamma gaþaursana habandin handu: urreis in midumai.
jah gaggandans þan Fareisaieis sunsaiw miþ þaim Herodianum garuni gatawidedun bi ina, ei imma usqemeina. The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.

A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.
For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him. managans auk gahailida, swaswe drusun ana ina ei imma attaitokeina, jah swa managai swe habaidedun wundufnjos

jah athaitands ins in gajukom qaþ du im: hvaiwa mag Satanas Satanan uswairpan? He summoned them, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?
jah jabai þiudangardi wiþra sik gadailjada, ni mag standan so þiudangardi jaina. If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can't stand, but has an end. jah jabai Satana usstoþ ana sik silban jah gadailiþs warþ, ni mag gastandan, ak andi habaiþ.

Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme; amen, qiþa izwis, þatei allata afletada þata frawaurhte sunum manne, jah naiteinos swa managos swaswe wajamerjand;

jah bisaihvands bisunjane þans bi sik sitandans qaþ: sai, aiþei meina jah þai broþrjus meinai. Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!
saei allis waurkeiþ wiljan gudis, sa jah broþar meins jah swistar jah aiþei ist. For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."
Jah aftra [Iesus] dugann laisjan at marein, jah galesun sik du imma manageins filu, swaswe ina galeiþan<dan> in skip gasitan in marein; jah alla so managei wiþra marein ana staþa was. Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.
"Listen! Behold, the farmer went out to sow, hauseiþ! sai, urrann sa saiands du saian fraiwa seinamma.
and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it. jah warþ, miþþanei saiso, sum raihtis gadraus faur wig, jah qemun fuglos jah fretun þata.
Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil. anþaruþ~þan gadraus ana stainahamma, þarei ni habaida airþa managa, jah suns urrann, in þizei ni habaida diupaizos airþos;

jah qaþ: saei habai ausona hausjandona, gahausjai. He said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."
jah qaþ im: izwis atgiban ist kunnan runa þiudangardjos gudis, iþ jainaim þaim uta in gajukom allata wairþiþ, He said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the Kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,
ei saihvandans saihvaina jah ni gaumjaina, jah hausjandans hausjaina jah ni fraþjaina, ibai hvan gawandjaina sik jah afletaindau im frawaurhteis. that 'seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.'"
sa saijands waurd saijiþ. The farmer sows the word.
jah þai sind þai in þaurnuns saianans, þai waurd hausjandans, Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,

For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light. nih allis ist hva fulginis þatei ni gabairhtjaidau: nih warþ analaugn, ak ei swikunþ wairþai.
If any man has ears to hear, let him hear." jabai hvas habai ausona hausjandona, gahausjai.

jah qaþ: hve galeikom þiudangardja gudis, aiþþau in hvileikai gajukon gabairam þo? He said, "How will we liken the Kingdom of God? Or with what parable will we illustrate it?
jah swaleikaim managaim gajukom rodida du im þata waurd, swaswe mahtedun hausjon. With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.
iþ inuh gajukon ni rodida im, iþ sundro siponjam seinaim andband allata. Without a parable he didn't speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.
jah qaþ du im in jainamma daga at andanahtja þan waurþanamma: usleiþam jainis stadis. On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let's go over to the other side."
Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him. jah afletandans þo managein andnemun ina swe was in skipa; jah þan anþara skipa wesun miþ imma.
jah warþ skura windis mikila jah wegos waltidedun in skip, swaswe ita juþan gafullnoda. A big wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.
jah was is ana notin ana waggarja slepands, jah urraisidedun ina jah qeþun du imma: laisari, niu kara þuk þizei fraqistnam? He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, "Teacher, don't you care that we are dying?"
They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?" jah ohtedun sis agis mikil jah qeþun du sis misso: hvas þannu sa sijai, unte jah winds jah marei ufhausjand imma?
When he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, jah usgaggandin imma us skipa suns gamotida imma manna us aurahjom in ahmin unhrainjamma,
who had his dwelling in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains, saei bauain habaida in aurahjom: jah ni naudibandjom eisarneinaim manna mahta ina gabindan.
jah frah ina: hva namo þein? jah qaþ du imma: namo mein Laigaion, unte managai sijum. He asked him, "What is your name?" He said to him, "My name is Legion, for we are many."
He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country. jah baþ ina filu ei ni usdrebi im us landa.
All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them." jah bedun ina allos þos unhulþons qiþandeins: insandei unsis in þo sweina, ei in þo galeiþaima.
jah atiddjedun du Iesua jah gasaihvand þana wodan sitandan jah gawasidana jah fraþjandan þana saei habaida laigaion, jah ohtedun. They came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by demons sitting, clothed, and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.
They began to beg him to depart from their region. jah dugunnun bidjan ina galeiþan hindar markos seinos.
jah inngaggandan ina in skip baþ ina, saei was wods, ei miþ imma wesi. As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.
jah ni lailot ina, ak qaþ du imma: gagg du garda þeinamma du þeinaim jah gateih im, hvan filu þus frauja gatawida jah gaarmaida þuk. He didn't allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how he had mercy on you."
He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled. jah galaiþ jah dugann merjan in Daikapaulein, hvan filu gatawida imma Iesus; jah allai sildaleikidedun.
When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea. jah usleiþandin Iesua in skipa aftra hindar marein, gaqemun sik manageins filu du imma, jah was faura marein.
jah qinono suma wisandei in runa bloþis jera twalif A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,
and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse, jah manag gaþulandei fram managaim lekjam jah fraqimandei allamma seinamma jah ni waihtai botida, ak mais wairs habaida,
Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction. jah sunsaiw gaþaursnoda sa brunna bloþis izos, jah ufkunþa ana leika þatei gahailnoda af þamma slaha.
Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, "Who touched my clothes?" jah sunsaiw Iesus ufkunþa in sis silbin þo us sis maht usgaggandein; gawandjands sik in managein qaþ: hvas mis taitok wastjom?
jah qeþun du imma siponjos is: saihvis þo managein þreihandein þuk jah qiþis: hvas mis taitok? His disciples said to him, "You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, 'Who touched me?'"
He looked around to see her who had done this thing. jah wlaitoda saihvan þo þata taujandein.

iþ is qaþ du izai: dauhtar, galaubeins þeina ganasida þuk, gagg in gawairþi jah sijais haila af þamma slaha þeinamma. He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease."

iþ Iesus sunsaiw gahausjands þata waurd rodiþ, qaþ du þamma swnagogafada: ni faurhtei, þatainei galaubei. But Jesus, when he heard the message spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don't be afraid, only believe."
He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John the brother of James. jah ni fralailot ainohun ize miþ sis afargaggan, nibai Paitru jah Iakobu jah Iohannen broþar Iakobis.
jah galaiþ in gard þis swnagogafadis jah gasahv auhjodu jah gretandans jah waifairhvjandans filu. He came to the synagogue ruler's house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.
When he had entered in, he said to them, "Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep." jah innatgaggands qaþ du im: hva auhjoþ jah gretiþ? þata barn ni gadauþnoda, ak slepiþ.
jah fairgraip bi handau þata barn qaþuh du izai: taleiþa kumei, þatei ist gaskeiriþ: mawilo, du þus qiþa: urreis. Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha cumi;" which means, being interpreted, "Girl, I tell you, get up."
Immediately the girl rose up, and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement. jah suns urrais so mawi jah iddja; was auk jere twalibe; jah usgeisnodedun faurhtein mikilai.
He strictly ordered them that no one should know this, and commanded that something should be given to her to eat. jah anabauþ im filu ei manna ni funþi þata; jah haihait izai giban matjan.

When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?
qaþ þan im Iesus þatei nist praufetus unswers, niba in gabaurþai seinai jah in ganiþjam jah in garda seinamma. Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."
jah sildaleikida in ungalaubeinais ize jah bitauh weihsa bisunjane laisjands. He marveled because of their unbelief. He went around the villages teaching.

Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"
They went out and preached that people should repent. jah usgaggandans meridedun ei idreigodedeina.
jah gahausida þiudans Herodes, swikunþ allis warþ namo is, jah qaþ þatei Iohannis sa daupjands us dauþaim urrais, <jah> duþþe waurkjand þos mahteis in imma. King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him."
But others said, "It is Elijah." Others said, "It is the Prophet, or like one of the prophets." anþarai þan qeþun þatei Helias ist; anþarai þan qeþun þatei praufetes ist swe ains þize praufete.
But Herod, when he heard this, said, "This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead." gahausjands þan Herodes qaþ þatei þammei ik haubiþ afmaimait Iohanne, sa ist: sah urrais us dauþaim.
Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn't, iþ so Herodia naiw imma jah wilda imma usqiman jah ni mahta;
When the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those sitting with him. The king said to the young lady, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you." jah atgaggandein inn dauhtar Herodiadins jah plinsjandein jah galeikandein Heroda jah þaim miþanakumbjandam, qaþ þiudans du þizai maujai: bidei mik þishvizuh þei wileis, jah giba þus.

They forgot to take bread; and they didn't have more than one loaf in the boat with them. jah ufarmunnodedun niman hlaibans jah niba ainana hlaif ni habaidedun miþ sis in skipa.
They reasoned with one another, saying, "It's because we have no bread." jah þahtedun miþ sis misso qiþandans: unte hlaibans ni habam.

He took hold of the blind man by the hand, and brought him out of the village.

Suddenly looking around, they saw no one with them any more, except Jesus only. jah anaks insaihvandans ni þanaseiþs ainohun gasehvun, alja Iesu ainana miþ sis.

Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward. þan nu taujais armaion, ni haurnjais faura þus, swaswe þai liutans taujand in gaqumþim jah in garunsim, ei hauhjaindau fram mannam; amen qiþa izwis: andnemun mizdon seina.

But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.
bidjandansuþ~þan ni filuwaurdjaiþ, swaswe þai þiudo; þugkeiþ im auk ei in filuwaurdein seinai andhausjaindau. In praying, don't use vain repetitions, as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking.
Pray like this: 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. swa nu bidjaiþ jus: atta unsar þu in himinam, weihnai namo þein.
qimai þiudinassus þeins. wairþai wilja þeins, swe in himina jah ana airþai. Let your Kingdom come. Let your will be done, as in heaven, so on earth.

unte jabai afletiþ mannam missadedins ize, afletiþ jah izwis atta izwar sa ufar himinam. "For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.

"Moreover when you fast, don't be like the hypocrites, with sad faces. For they disfigure their faces, that they may be seen by men to be fasting. Most certainly I tell you, they have received their reward.
But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face; iþ þu fastands salbo haubiþ þein jah ludja þeina þwah,
ei ni gasaihvaizau mannam fastands, ak attin þeinamma þamma in fulhsnja, jah atta þeins saei saihviþ in fulhsnja, usgibiþ þus. so that you are not seen by men to be fasting, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you.

iþ huzdjaiþ izwis huzda in himina, þarei nih malo nih nidwa frawardeiþ, jah þarei þiubos ni ufgraband nih stiland. but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consume, and where thieves don't break through and steal;

"No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can't serve both God and Mammon. ni manna mag twaim fraujam skalkinon; unte jabai fijaiþ ainana, jah anþarana frijoþ; aiþþau ainamma ufhauseiþ, iþ anþaramma frakann. ni maguþ guda skalkinon jah mammonin.
Therefore, I tell you, don't be anxious for your life: what you will eat, or what you will drink; nor yet for your body, what you will wear. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothing? Duþþe qiþa izwis: ni maurnaiþ saiwalai izwarai hva matjaiþ jah hva drigkaiþ, nih leika izwaramma hve wasjaiþ; niu saiwala mais ist fodeinai jah leik wastjom?

Therefore whatever you desire for men to do to you, you shall also do to them; for this is the law and the prophets. ... (tau)jaina izwis mans, swa jah jus taujaiþ im: þata auk ist witoþ jah praufeteis.

Every tree that doesn't grow good fruit is cut down, and thrown into the fire. all bagme ni taujandane akran god usmaitada jah in fon atlagjada.
Therefore, by their fruits you will know them. þannu bi akranam ize ufkunnaiþ ins.

When he came down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. Dalaþ þan atgaggandin imma af fairgunja, laistidedun afar imma iumjons managos.
Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, "I want to. Be made clean." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. jah ufrakjands handu attaitok imma qiþands: wiljau, wairþ hrains! jah suns hrain warþ þata þrutsfill is.

jah qiþands: frauja, þiumagus meins ligiþ in garda usliþa, harduba balwiþs. and saying, "Lord, my servant lies in the house paralyzed, grievously tormented."
Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him." jah qaþ du imma Iesus: ik qimands gahailja ina.
For I am also a man under authority, having under myself soldiers. I tell this one, 'Go,' and he goes; and tell another, 'Come,' and he comes; and tell my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it." jah auk ik manna im habands uf waldufnja meinamma gadrauhtins jah qiþa du þamma: gagg, jah gaggiþ; jah anþaramma: qim, jah qimiþ; jah du skalka meinamma: tawei þata, jah taujiþ.

jah qaþ du imma Iesus: fauhons grobos aigun, jah fuglos himinis sitlans, iþ sunus mans ni habaiþ hvar haubiþ sein anahnaiwjai. Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head."
When he got into a boat, his disciples followed him. jah innatgaggandin imma in skip, afariddjedun imma siponjos is.
Behold, a violent storm came up on the sea, so much that the boat was covered with the waves, but he was asleep. jah sai, wegs mikils warþ in marein, swaswe þata skip gahuliþ wairþan fram wegim; iþ is saislep.
iþ þai mans sildaleikidedun qiþandans: hvileiks ist sa, ei jah windos jah marei ufhausjand imma? The men marveled, saying, "What kind of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"
When he came to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, two people possessed by demons met him there, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that nobody could pass that way. jah qimandin imma hindar marein in gauja Gairgaisaine, gamotidedun imma twai daimonarjos us hlaiwasnom rinnandans, sleidjai filu, swaswe ni mahta manna usleiþan þairh þana wig jainana.
Behold, they cried out, saying, "What do we have to do with you, Jesus, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?" jah sai, hropidedun qiþandans: hva uns jah þus, Iesu, sunau gudis? qamt her faur mel balwjan unsis?

He said to them, "Go!" They came out, and went into the herd of pigs: and behold, the whole herd of pigs rushed down the cliff into the sea, and died in the water. jah qaþ du im: gaggiþ! iþ eis usgaggandans galiþun in hairda sweine; jah sai, run gawaurhtedun sis alla so hairda and driuson in marein jah gadauþnodedun in watnam.
Those who fed them fled, and went away into the city, and told everything, including what happened to those who were possessed with demons. iþ þai haldandans gaþlauhun jah galeiþandans gataihun in baurg all bi þans daimonarjans.
jah sai, alla so baurgs usiddja wiþra Iesu, jah gasaihvandans ina bedun ei usliþi hindar markos ize. Behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged that he would depart from their borders.
Behold, they brought to him a man who was paralyzed, lying on a bed. Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, cheer up! Your sins are forgiven you." þanuh atberun du imma usliþan ana ligra ligandan. jah gasaihvands Iesus galaubein ize qaþ du þamma usliþin: þrafstei þuk, barnilo! afletanda þus frawaurhteis þeinos.
Behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man blasphemes." þaruh sumai þize bokarje qeþun in sis silbam: sa wajamereiþ.
But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins..." (then he said to the paralytic), "Get up, and take up your mat, and go up to your house." Aþþan ei witeiþ þatei waldufni habaiþ sa sunus mans ana airþai afleitan frawaurhtins, þanuh qaþ du þamma usliþin: urreisands nim þana ligr þeinana jah gagg in gard þeinana.
iþ Iesus gahausjands qaþ du im: ni þaurbun hailai lekeis, ak þai unhaili habandans. When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick do.
But you go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." Aþþan gaggaiþ, ganimiþ hva sijai: armahairtiþa wiljau jah ni hunsl; niþ~þan qam laþon uswaurhtans, ak frawaurhtans.
Then John's disciples came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?" þanuh atiddjedun siponjos Iohannes qiþandans: duhve weis jah Fareisaieis fastam filu, iþ þai siponjos þeinai ni fastand?

Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
aþþan ni hvashun lagjiþ du plata fanan þarihis ana snagan fairnjana, unte afnimiþ fullon af þamma snagin, jah wairsiza gataura wairþiþ. No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch would tear away from the garment, and a worse hole is made.

Neither do people put new wine into old wineskins, or else the skins would burst, and the wine be spilled, and the skins ruined. No, they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
Jesus got up and followed him, as did his disciples. jah urreisands Iesus iddja afar imma jah siponjos is.
Behold, a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years came behind him, and touched the fringe of his garment; jah sai, qino bloþarinnandei ·ib· wintruns duatgaggandei aftaro attaitok skauta wastjos is;
When Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd in noisy disorder, jah qimands Iesus in garda þis reikis jah gasaihvands swigljans [jah haurnjans haurnjandans] jah managein auhjondein, qaþ du im:

The report of this went out into all that land. jah usiddja meriþa so and alla jaina airþa.
As Jesus passed by from there, two blind men followed him, calling out and saying, "Have mercy on us, son of David!" jah hvarbondin Iesua jainþro, laistidedun afar imma twai blindans, hropjandans jah qiþandans: armai uggkis, sunau Daweidis!
When he had come into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They told him, "Yes, Lord." Qimandin þan in garda duatiddjedun imma þai blindans jah qaþ im Iesus: ga~u~laubjats þatei magjau þata taujan? Qeþun du imma: jai, frauja!
Their eyes were opened. Jesus strictly charged them, saying, "See that no one knows about this." jah usluknodedun im augona, jah inagida ins Iesus qiþands: saihvats ei manna ni witi.
But they went out and spread abroad his fame in all that land. iþ eis usgaggandans usmeridedun ina in allai airþai jainai.
As they went out, behold, a mute man who was demon possessed was brought to him. þanuh biþe utusiddjedun eis, sai, atberun imma mannan baudana daimonari.

jah bitauh Iesus baurgs allos jah haimos laisjands in gaqumþim ize, jah merjands aiwaggeljon þiudangardjos jah hailjands allos sauhtins jah alla unhailja. Jesus went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Good News of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed{TR reads "weary" instead of "harassed"} and scattered, like sheep without a shepherd. gasaihvands þan þos manageins infeinoda in ize, unte wesun afdauidai jah frawaurpanai swe lamba ni habandona hairdeis.

Jah athaitands þans twalif si(ponjans) ... He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.
It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!

"Aren't two sparrows sold for an assarion coin{An assarion is a small coin worth one tenth of a drachma or a sixteenth of a denarius (approximately the wages of one half hour of agricultural labor).}? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father's will,

He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet's reward: and he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man's reward. sa andnimands praufetu in namin praufetaus mizdon praufetaus nimiþ, jah sa andnimands garaihtana in namin garaihtis mizdon garaihtis nimiþ.

Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward."

Jah warþ, biþe ustauh Iesus alla þo waurda, qaþ siponjam sein(aim): It happened, when Jesus had finished all these words, that he said to his disciples,

When he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing. jah miþþanei wrohiþs was fram þaim gudjam jah sinistam, ni waiht andhof.
